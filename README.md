## About Me

I have a diverse range of interests within the field of software development, including web development, reverse engineering, and open-source projects. I enjoy collaborating with others and learning from many communities.

## Notable Repositories

### 1. [Raider](https://github.com/AveryMadness/raider)

This repository contains the code for my first real project, Raider. It is a modification of the [raider3.5](https://github.com/kem0x/raider3.5) Fortnite game server, designed to add more features and ideas to the original code. 

### 2. [Satellite](https://github.com/AveryMadness/Satellite)

This repository contains the current project I am working on. A Fortnite game server, using the knowledge I learned from working on Raider, and other projects. It is early in development, and likely won't be released any time soon, but it is what I am currently working on and maintaining.

### 3. [Item Game](https://github.com/ItemGame/ItemGame)

Item Game is a very early prototype of the game I am currently working on. It is extremely early development, and likely won't even retain this name.

## Contributions

I actively contribute to various projects and enjoy working with others to improve the software development community. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to let me know.
